# Link Blocks

These are blocks used to display link content in various ways.

- The `Bookmark` block supports displaying general web content with optional style configurations to display as cards of different styles.
- The `EmbedLinkedDoc` block supports embedding other BlockSuite documents as linked cards, also with various style configurations.
- The `EmbedSyncedDoc` block supports embedding other BlockSuite documents as editable sub-documents, based on the first-party transclusion support provided by BlockSuite.
